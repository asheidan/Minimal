# Welcome to Minimal

Minimal is a tiny CMS. So tiny in fact that it isn't a CMS. What you can do is
write articles (well, no template yet, stick to markdown and you'll be fine),
import your written articles into your database.

What more do you want?
Oh, I want to remove my articles from the database you say, well, okay then.
That is also possible...
